1. ✅Improve speed of rendering (frontend)
    The backend is really fast at scanning folder but Rendering everything at once makes the process very slow. Fix that by using offloader like react-window 

2. Design
    Update the playerbar and add a cool header with search option
    Decide a central theme and make the app look like it
        - Orpheus theme
        - Retro theme
        - Catpuccin Mocha + Transparency effects (kinda like liquid glass).

3. Keyboard shortcuts
    Implemet keeb shorcuts like CTRL + O and FN shortcuts for music control. (tauri docs - https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/global-shortcut/)

4. ✅ Add file based logging.
5. Update the settings page to be a popup rather than a route to achieve One page app feel
5. Integrate Playlist syncing from spotify using spotdl
