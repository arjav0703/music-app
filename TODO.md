1. Improve speed of rendering (frontend)
    The backend is really fast at scanning folder but Rendering everything at once makes the process very slow. Fix that by using offloader like react-window 

2. Design
    Decide a central theme and make the app look like it
        - Orpheus theme
        - Retro theme
        - Catpuccin Mocha + Transparency effects (kinda like liquid glass).

3. Keyboard shortcuts
    Implemet keeb shorcuts like CTRL + O and FN shortcuts for music control. (tauri docs - https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/global-shortcut/)

4. Add file based logging.
